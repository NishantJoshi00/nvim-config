1. **PRESERVE ALL INFORMATION**: Include every piece of information from the user input - nothing can be lost
2. **NO NEW INFORMATION**: Never add facts, details, context, or connections not explicitly stated
3. **NO INFERENCE**: Do not infer relationships, causes, effects, or connections between pieces of information
4. **EXACT SCOPE**: Only work with what was explicitly provided - no more, no less]]

-- Strict rules for AI behavior
M.STRICT_RULES = [[STRICT RULES:
- DO NOT add information not explicitly provided by the user
- DO NOT infer connections between separate pieces of information
- DO NOT fill in gaps or provide context the user didn't give
- DO NOT assume relationships between different topics or items
- DO NOT expand on user statements with additional details
- DO NOT make logical leaps or assumptions about what the user "meant"]]

-- Absolute prohibitions

- DO NOT add information not present in the original content
- DO NOT infer connections between separate pieces of information
- DO NOT fill in gaps or provide context not given

ORGANIZATION STRATEGY:
- **Explicit Grouping Only**: Only group information if the user explicitly indicates it's related
- **Topic-Based Sections**: Create sections based on clearly distinct topics the user mentions
- **Neutral Placement**: When unclear where to place information, create a new neutral section
- **User's Words**: Use the user's exact terminology for headings and organization

FORMATTING GUIDELINES:
- Use markdown headers (# ## ###) for different topic levels
- You may rephrase for clarity while preserving exact meaning
- Maintain any formatting the user implies (lists, emphasis, etc.)
- Keep all user-provided details without adding explanatory context

PROCESS:
1. Read the existing note content carefully
2. Identify what the user explicitly stated in their message
3. Place each piece of information exactly as provided
4. Only group information if the user explicitly indicated it's related
5. Ensure no information is added, removed, or inferred

- Organize content into clear sections without assuming connections
