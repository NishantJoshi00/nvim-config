## NVIM Configuration

This is my personal neovim configuration. It is a work in progress as I find new ways to organize my configuration. I have been using neovim for a few years now and have been through many iterations of my configuration. I have finally settled on a configuration that I am happy with and that I can maintain.

I will now start to tag the configuration so that I can easily revert to a previous state if I make a change that I do not like.

## Installation

To install the configuration, you will need to clone the repository to your XDG_CONFIG_HOME directory. If you do not have an XDG_CONFIG_HOME directory, you can clone the repository to `~/.config/nvim`.

```bash
$ cd $XDG_CONFIG_HOME
$ git clone https://github.com/NishantJoshi00/nvim-config.git nvim
```

## Contributing

If you would like to contribute to the configuration, feel free to open a pull request. I am always open to new ideas and ways to improve my configuration.
